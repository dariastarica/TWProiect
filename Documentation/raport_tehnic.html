    <p>
       MEq is a mathematical forum, very similar to our well-known StackOverflow, but dedicated to mathematics. Our web application is designed for users to interact with each other, comment on posts, interact with other people that have the same passion: numbers and logic. 
      </p>

        The website is written in <b><code>PHP</code></b>, <b><code>HTML 5</code></b> and <b><code>CSS</code></b>, following the <b><code>Ajax</code></b>methodology.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><code>MongoDB</code></b>(aliniată paradigmei <code>NoSQL</code>) este folosită pentru gestionarea datelor folosite în aplicație.

               We use our data base a lot! You might see that as soon as you interact with one of our categories. 
               Trying to improve our user experience, we made it as easy as possible for a user to surf the comments. The connection with the database is constant and necessary, obviously, in order for our system to work. 
               Our local server withhelds a bunch of interactions the user has and transfers it further to the data base.

            <h3 id="Beginning">Beginning</h3>
            <p>
               All three of us are very passionated about math. We all settled on this project as soon as we set our eyes on it. 
            </p>
            <h3 id="work">Progress over time</h3>
          <p>The first 5 weeks were dedicated to research and design implementation. We struggled at first trying to find a work pace that works for all of us, but we found ourself fascinated at the fact that we all have the same working schedule: at night. We set up a github repo on Maria's account, but that didn't last very long as we encountered pushing problems (something related to the Software Engineering course - too many commits were made for a simple free acount). We worked around that, having the final version of the project in here:  <a href="https://github.com/dariastarica/TWProiect">GitHub</a>. 
            We made sure our communication was healthy and productive, having regular discussions on <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a>.</p>
<p>Time passed and we managed to finish the final version of our design for the project. The time came for our inner back-ends developers to be unleashed: we wrote our very first line of PHP together and discovered we actually liked it. We implemented a lot of functionalities thanks to the videos we watched on our professor's YouTube channel. The only problem we encountered was being overflown with work from many FII Projects and missing the 12th Web Technologies course: the AJAX one. We wrote everything without it and realised that a little... late. So we gathered in person this time and worked our around it in order to deliver a fully functional beautiful project we are very proud of.</p>
          
          <h3 id="end">The end</h3>
          <p>
            We have sincerely surprised ourselves. We had no idea how to open XAMPP 14 weeks ago and now here we are: Senior web developers!
