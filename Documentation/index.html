    <h2 id="about">Web application's essentials</h2>
    <p>
      MEq is the perfect web tool for communication inside a mathematical enthusiasts community. This is were equations, regardless of their popularity get the chance to gain some exposure. 
      Discussions are prone to arise, exercises can be solved and opinions can be shared.
      
      </p>
       <h3 id="Home">Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page is the first contact an user has with the application. This is the starting point - there's no going back! 
      </p>
      <h3 id="News">News page</h3>
      <p>
        The news page is a feature of MEq's that allows us to visualise the newest equation added by any user in the world. 
      </p>
      <h3 id="Categories">Categories page</h3>
      <p>
        Categories is the page where we get to choose our path from now on. We got four options: Calculus, Algebra, Trigonometry and Geometry. 
        Each of these opens a new gate for new oportunities of discussions, problem-solving and skills development.
      </p>
      <h3 id="Contact">Contact page</h3>
      <p>
        This is were you can find the very passionated and reliable developers that worked day and night for this app to happen!
      </p>

  <section id="user-experience" role="user-experience"  typeof="user-experience">
      <h2>User experience</h2>
      <h3 id="first-use-case">First use-case: <i>the home page</i></h3>
      <p>The home page allows the user to choose the experience he's going to get once he hops on the mathematical journey. After he gets familiar with the new-edge design, he gets the chance to explore one of the following pages: </p>
      <h3 id="second-use-case">Second use-case: <i>the news page</i></h3>
      <p>It comes in handy at times to have acces to every news there is. That's why the developers have brought to us the News Page, which makes sure that we stay connected with everything that's going on in the mathematical world. This page displays the newest equations that are up for the discussion.</p>
      <h3 id="third-use-case">Thirst use-case: <i>the categories page</i></h3>
      <p> The categories page is the goddess of all pages. As it looks soft at first, we know for sure that it holds the most functionalitites of the website, hidden between four attractive icons that draw us to the world of mathematics. We are shown here 4 representative images that make us think about Calculus, Algebra, Trigonometry and Geometry. All of those stated above are important areas of mathematics and the developers figured that people might have preferences regarding their interest, obviously. So if any trigonometry-enthusiast choose to join our application, they are more than welcome to surf that area of our cateogory. Within these subsections, the developers managed to hide an amazing display of equations added by the users: everyone can view equations, comments and exercise, while only the true MEq subscribers can contribute for the community: the logged ones! 
      </p>
     <h3 id="fourth-use-case">Fourth use-case <i>the contact page</i></h3>
     <p>
      We all know it's important to market our brightest minds, so here's a page that promotes their potential to anyone that chooses to surf this website.

      <h2>Design motivation</h2>
      <p>Our team consists in a bunch of pretentious pupils that always tend to be perfectionists. All of us have decided to adapt to a cutting-edge design, with a colour palette that represents us: we all carry in our souls an undying love for #808000 (the most beautiful shade of green). We tried to switch from a "darkish" theme in the front page to something more light-hearted in order to satisfy any kind of viewer - be it a night owl or a morning lark. We really put a lot of emphasize on the user design - but more importantly - on the user experience. Our priority is making a user feel like this website was designed for them. We chose a combination of Roboto and Ubuntu fonts - both internatioanlly known for their usability and malleability in the design world. Easy to read and very eye-pleasant, we hope that the typefaces bring our users the experience they deserve. Last of all, we are glad to have contributed to the beautiful world of mathematics in any way we can and we are sure to have learnt an amazing lot about technical design.
